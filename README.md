Project Dixcrition: Dynamic Energy Map User Interface Design
## Author(s):

## Purpose:
The main interface (manySlider.py) enables user to view dynamic changes of heating and cooling demand of a conceptual urban environment setting.
## General Functions:
The heating and cooling demand profile is generated from DOE benchmark building (post 1980) and is color coded with a two dimensional color ramp. The energy demand information is demonstrated with data plot on the right of the interface, the 3D urban space model on the top left and the "tick marks" on the lower left. The navigation between different time of year (one of the 8760 hours) is controlled by a series of sliders: one all-year-round slider on the bottom left and three stepped sliders that control jumping with specific steps of month, day and hour.
