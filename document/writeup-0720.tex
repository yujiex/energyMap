\title{Dynamic Energy Mapping Project Outline}
\maketitle
\tableofcontents
\newpage
\begin{abstract}
  This document provides an approach of adding the ``time'' dimension
  to an Energy Map. The approach is demonstrated with a model of a
  conceptual urban setting created in CityEngine based on the
  extracted topological and density pattern from an existing urban
  design project. The buildings in the conceptual model is then
  assigned an energy profile of certain DOE Commercial Benchmark
  Building Reference model based on its building type. Hourly energy
  demand profile of heating and cooling end use is then obtained from
  the EnergyPlus Reference models. The energy consumption data is
  classified into groups with consideration of building energy design
  context and the data distribution properties. A corresponding color
  coded energy profile is then generated and imported to
  CityEngine. 8760 color coded 3D map images was then extracted from
  CityEngine with Python script. A data reading, ploting,
  color-coding calculation and a user interface for visualizing the
  images and dynamic data plot with sliders is implemented using
  Python and related packages. The tool is anticipated to provide
  decision support for community energy management and
  planning, demand-side strategy design and district system sizing.
  
  The document will also briefly discuss one of the testbed for data
  classification and visualization.

\section{General Introduction}
\subsection{Definition of Energy Map: Urban Energy Geo-database}
In a restricted sense, Energy Map is an instance of a thematic map
that depicts energy information. More generally, an energy map is an
abstract representation of some energy feature in an urban
environment. It is useful in providing qualitative or quantitative
insight of the energy feature it represents. The energy related
features depicted in an energy map can be classified into two major
categories: the supply side and the demand side. The following
discussions will be based on the two main categories.

Energy map is a hibernation of two types of databases: building energy
database, a subset of the BIM (Building Information Model) system and
GIS (Geographical Information System). The basic functions of an
energy map includes 1) storing energy data in an organized fashion,
that facilitate easy analysis and query of energy data and 2) provide
reports in the form of graphs, tables, animations etc that conveys
numerical information in a way that best support pattern recognition
and decision support.

\subsection{Why ``time'' dimension is important for an Energy Map}
\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
\item Demand Side is strongly time dependent

  The demand of energy is strongly dependent on weather condition and
  building types, operation schedules. Weather conditions have
  strongly seasonal pattern and periodical daily pattern. This type of
  variation takes the form of a global influence on heating or cooling
  load. The building operation schedule of different building types
  vary greatly which indicate a non-coherent arrival of peak
  demand. In order to match the supply side to the demand side,
  understanding the strongly the spatial-temporal pattern of the
  energy demand is crutial.

\item Supply Side should better match the demand side in energy supply
  timing and intensity for reducing total consumption

  Mark!!!!!!
  The major energy source used in the building sector are electricity
  and natural gas: 3559 tBtu (55\%) electricity and 2100 tBtu (32\%)
  natural gas were consumed for the commertial building sector,
  ~\cite{CBECS2003}. In RECS 2009, the space heating (42\%) and
  lighting and appliances (30\%) accounted for over 70\% of
  residential energy consumption~\cite{HomeEnergyEIA2015}.

  \par As the result of the finiteness of fossil fuels, the using of
  renewable energy begins to come into play. In 2013, renewable energy
  account for 9\% of the residential and commercial primary energy
  source~\cite{EIAPrimary2013}.
  \end{comment}
  
\item Community Energy Planning and District system design
  requires a more detailed picture of the energy temporal behavior
  on community level
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{General Description of Dynamic Energy Map}
\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
\item Dynamic Map holds 8760-hour meta data of energy demand
    and supply
\item Dynamic Map has multi-dimensional graphical display of the
    meta data in conveying spatial-temporal pattern
    \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item 1D: data plot for providing quantitative information
    \item 2D/3D: graphical display of spatial relationship of energy 
    data
    \item 1D + 2D/3D: interactive graphical display of
    spatial-temporal pattern of energy data
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Limitations of the current implementation
    \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item Simplified building simulation assumption about urban
      environment
    \item Lack of user choices for the stand-alone user interface as a
      result of its dependence on existing modeling softwares
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Future Expansion of the project
    \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item Adding information of the supply side: residual energy,
      sustainable energy
    \item Providing different interfaces for different user population
    \item 2D and 3D compatible \\The reason for providing 2D map
      together with 3D map is that 2D maps have the following good
      properties:
      \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
      \item Better for region selection and spatial navigation than 3D
        map
      \item Better for conveying spatial relationship that does not
        involve height induced variation
      \item For larger scale display of city, state or nationwide, 3D
        building geometries becomes less significant in providing the
        urban environment context
