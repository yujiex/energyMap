abstract = "Community energy management (CEM) (also called community energy planning) combines planning concepts - neo-traditional design, complete communities, green cities - with energy management concepts - energy cascading, demand-side management, integrated resource planning. It can be applied at the level of neighborhoods, cities and even small regions in order to exploit the synergies between urban design objectives for livable cities and energy management objectives of minimizing energy use and its associated environmental effects for a given standard of living. \{CEM\} encompasses (i) land use planning, (ii) transportation management, (iii) site design, and (iv) local energy supply and delivery planning. While traditional energy management focuses on energy using equipment and buildings, \{CEM\} also considers the urban land use and infrastructure level. This study applies \{CEM\} to four representative communities in British Columbia, Canada, over the period 1995 to 2010, and compares the results to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. The aggregate effect is a decrease in energy service costs and energy consumption of 15–30\%, and in air emissions (CO2 and NOx) of 30–45\%. The methodology and results, with respect to one aspect of \{CEM\} - land use planning - are extrapolated to the provincial level in order to estimate total \{CO2\} emission reduction portential. \{CO2\} emissions are reduced by 17\% from BAU. Additional approximate calculations (restricted to land use planning) suggest that on a global scale \{CEM\} can be an important element in the greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy, especially given the dramatic urban growth anticipated in developing countries in the coming decades. Implementation of \{CEM\} requires an array of policy initiatives from governments at all levels, as the following examples illustrate. National and provincial (state) governments can (i) change the legislation governing regional and muncipal land use planning, (ii) tie infrastructure grants to \{CEM\} type municipal investments, and (iii) provide information support and fiscal incentives for developers. Regional and municipal governments can (i) change zoning objectives, (ii) encourage specific types of developments through development charges and tax incentives to developers, and (iii) work with energy and other utilities to encourage particular energy forms and delivery systems.

abstract = "An energy resource that is renewed by nature and whose supply is not affected by the rate of consumption is often termed as renewable energy. The need to search for renewable, alternate and non-polluting sources of energy assumes top priority for self-reliance in the regional energy supply. This demands an estimation of available energy resources spatially to evolve better management strategies for ensuring sustainability of resources. The spatial mapping of availability and demand of energy resources would help in the integrated regional energy planning through an appropriate energy supply–demand matching. This paper discusses the application of Geographical Information System (GIS) to map the renewable energy potential talukwise in Karnataka State, India. Taluk is an administrative division in the federal set-up in India to implement developmental programmes like dissemination of biogas, improved stoves, etc. Hence, this paper focuses talukwise mapping of renewable energy (solar, wind, bioenergy and small hydroenergy) potential for Karnataka using GIS. {GIS} helps in spatial and temporal analyses of the resources and demand and also aids as Decision Support System while implementing location-specific renewable energy technologies. Regions suitable for tapping solar energy are mapped based on global solar radiation data, which provides a picture of the potential. Coastal taluks in Uttara Kannada have higher global solar radiation during summer (6.31&#xa0;kWh/m2), monsoon (4.16&#xa0;kWh/m2) and winter (5.48&#xa0;kWh/m2). Mapping of regions suitable for tapping wind energy has been done based on wind velocity data, and it shows that Chikkodi taluk, Belgaum district, has higher potential during summer (6.06&#xa0;m/s), monsoon (8.27&#xa0;m/s) and winter (5.19&#xa0;m/s). Mysore district has the maximum number of small hydropower plants with a capacity of 36&#xa0;MW. Talukwise computation of bioenergy availability from agricultural residue, forest, horticulture, plantation and livestock indicates that Channagiri taluk in Shimoga district yields maximum bioenergy. The bioenergy status analysis shows that Siddapur taluk in Uttara Kannada district has the highest bioenergy status of 2.004 (ratio of bioresource availability and demand). "

Although this is currently rare in the UK, many legislative policies, including the Renewable Heat Incentive, aim to increase the amount of energy from such sources; including new installations, as well as extending/upgrading existing distributed energy schemes. Sheffield already has an award-winning district energy network, incorporating city-wide heat distribution. This paper aimed to demonstrate the opportunities for expansions to this through geographical information systems software modelling for an in-depth analysis of the heat demands in the city. ‘Heat maps’ were produced, locating existing and emerging heat sources and sinks. Heat loads (industrial, commercial, educational, health care, council and leisure facilities/complex) total 53&#xa0;MW, with existing residential areas accounting for ∼1500&#xa0;MW and new housing developments potentially adding a further 35&#xa0;MW in the future. A number of current and emerging heat sources were also discovered – potential suppliers of thermal energy to the above-defined heat sinks. From these, six ‘heat zones’ where an expansion to the existing network could be possible were identified and the infrastructure planned for each development. "

We first report on the HEAT Phase I pilot project which evaluates 368 residences in the Brentwood community of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and describe the development and implementation of interactive waste heat maps, energy use models, a Hot Spot tool able to view the 6+ hottest locations on each home and a new HEAT Score for inter-city waste heat comparisons. We then describe current challenges, lessons learned and new solutions as we begin Phase II and scale from 368 to 300,000+ homes with the newly developed TABI-1800. Specifically, we introduce a new object-based mosaicing strategy, an adaptation of Emissivity Modulation to correct for emissivity differences, a new Thermal Urban Road Normalization (TURN) technique to correct for scene-wide microclimatic variation. We also describe a new Carbon Score and opportunities to update city cadastral errors with automatically defined thermal house objects.''

    abstract = { For marine logistics and maintenance of extensive and expensive marine engineering projects in the coastal zone, it is essential that institutions provide the public with relevant information in an easily understandable yet comprehensive manner over the web. A perennial challenge, however, has been the development of spatio-temporal (four-dimensional (4D)) geo-visualization algorithms to enable the integration of time-varying geo-information in map-based visualizations on the Internet. In this paper, we address the challenge of visualizing marine spatial data in web-based applications through a 4D visualization concept, focusing on usability criteria, performance parameters, the required implementation effort, and delivering a breath of spatial information that supports decision-making on multiple levels. We used Web Graphic Library (WebGL) to validate our concept through a prototypical implementation. In our technology evaluation, WebGL proved highly suitable for the development of interactive, responsive, efficient, and mobile web-based Geographic Information applications, including 2D, 3D, and 4D (spatiotemporal) content. During our research, we identified a number of open research questions, including mapping graphic variables to thematic expressivity, representation of the time dimension in 4D systems, generic temporal generalization, and integration of (pseudo-)photorealistic illustrations in web-based geo-visualization systems. }

abstract = "Abstract This study proposes a site location potential model for urban energy supply plants and renewable energy availability using an environment and energy geographical information system (E-GIS) database (DB) and an artificial neural network (ANN). This model addresses the technical methodology of examining the potential for the suitability of urban energy supply plants and renewable energy latency in a region for support material for urban energy supply planning in the draft plan development stage. The applicability of this model is examined by applying it for a planned city in the Republic of Korea, where urban planning is in process. The results from this study are as follows:(1) The E-GIS \{DB\} was integrated with geography, climate, and energy-related information to construct an \{ANN\} model that can manage, in an integrated manner, the factors that affect the site location of the energy supply plants. (2) The input dataset included the topography, land cover classification, accessibility, water usability, and energy demand, and the target dataset included the system capacity of domestically installed energy supply plants. (3) The site location potential model of the \{ANN\} for the urban energy supply plants and renewable energy availability was deduced, and the Levenberg–Marquardt (trainlm) and scaled conjugate gradient (trainscg) algorithms were used. The potentiality class map was constructed for 10 types of energy supply systems and renewable energy resources. (4) The applicability of this energy model was tested in the Gwang-myung/Si-heung public housing district area, a domestic ‘planned city’ of the Republic of Korea. The most appropriate urban energy supply systems for the research area were considered to be the general hydraulic power and solar power based on the topographic conditions and profitable locations for solar resources in Korea. Wind power generation was found to be the least suitable. (5) In terms of the wind energy potential, the technical wind power generation by horizontal – axis wind turbines is unattainable even in the area that has the maximum wind speed, and at least a 10-kW rated power wind turbine should be installed for vertical – axis wind turbines in the research area of interest. In terms of the solar energy potential, the maximum electric power generation potential is 413, 186&#xa0;MJ/month·mesh, which is applied by mono-crystalline bulk PV. "

** NOTES **

 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.

 3. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).
