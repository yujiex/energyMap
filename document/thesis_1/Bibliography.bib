abstract = {The study of spatiotemporal dynamics is certainly not new, nor is it unique to the field of geography. Nevertheless, addressing complex human and environmental issues such as global warming and human impacts on the environment requires empirical examination from a much broader and integrated perspective than can be accomplished with current techniques. Although Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are intended to provide an integrated and flexible tool for analyzing large volumes of data, they are historically geared toward the representation and analysis of situations frozen in time. Efforts to enhance the temporal capabilities of GIS have served to reveal many problems at a fundamental conceptual level. In order to address this problem, this paper presents a new Triad representational approach that unifies temporal- as well as locational- and object-related aspects and that incorporates concepts from perceptual psychology, artificial intelligence, and other fields. The goal of this research is a drawing-together of a range of concepts and ideas not only to improve our representational and analytical capabilities, but also to provide more common ground among the various fields noted above. The discrete yet interrelated time-, location-, and object-based views incorporated within the Triad framework allow for questions to be asked and answered relative to each of those aspects. Fundamental types of temporal relationships are also defined as part of the temporal view.},

Definitions of geodesign are reviewed, together with a short history of the concept. A distinction is drawn between Design and design, the latter being addressed through spatial decision support systems, and the former being seen as a superset of the latter. Geodesign also has a strong and well-defined relationship with cartography. The vision of landscape architecture propounded by the late Ian McHarg also provides a foundation for geodesign. Two existing gaps in the computation tools available for geodesign are identified: support for sketch and implementation of models representing scientific knowledge of how the world works. Two important areas of research are identified that would address problems that currently impede geodesign.},
