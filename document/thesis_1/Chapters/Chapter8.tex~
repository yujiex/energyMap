\section{Insight of energy mapping with time information}
Along the path of community energy planning and the increasing
development of energy mapping approaches that assist community level
sustainable design, the current project demonstrated some possible
approaches to add the time dimension and reflect the time-of-use
energy demand behavior in an community energy map.

The project is developed based on the Lower Hill District
Project~\cite{baird2014} and improved it by aggregating energy demand
profile to each building with higher temporal resolution, and by
creating a dynamic energy map interface that combines the
visualization of high resolution spatial temporal energy data in the
form of a series of time-indexed choropleth map images with
color-coded energy consumption. It also provides energy data
aggregation method over space and time. Due to increased data
complexity, the visualization of a dynamic energy map poses more
challenges~\cite{Dorling1992}. Creating an effective visualization to
convey the complicated energy demand changing of buildings and the
whole community becomes one of the problems the project aims to solve.

The researcher has experimented with the continuous and discrete
method of converting energy data to its color encoding and identified
the evaluation of the two method to be one of the next stage
development in the visualization section of the current dynamic energy
map. In the map display design, considering the demonstration purpose,
the color encoding and the data classification ensures the buildings
with high energy demand stand out with vibrant color and that the
color distribution on each frame is relatively even.

Visualization can assist understanding of the general pattern of the
space-time energy data, but mathematical description and
identification of pattern is still necessary to provide quantitative
insight and to validate the pattern recognized in
visualization. Lacking data analysis functions push the pattern
recognition task entirely to the visualization, which itself lack
established standards as is addressed in the study of Resch et al.\
~\cite{Resch2014}. Thus the researcher also identifies the necessity
to equip the current dynamic energy map with more advanced space-time
data analysis functions to be one of the focus of next stage
development.

By providing additional plotting tools that presents exact and
aggregated demand profile over space and time, the project asserts
that the dynamic energy map could reveal complicated time-dependent
thermal energy and electricity demand changing behavior including:
\begin{itemize}
\item the non-coincident peak arrival time of a certain energy end use
  between different building types,
\item the different daily, weekly and monthly demand profile or their
  aggregated forms such as average, peak and total demand between
  different building types,
\item the non-coincident demand peak of different building energy end
  uses including heating, cooling and electricity.
\end{itemize}

These detailed information are not shown in the static energy maps
because the demand side variables depicted in a static energy map are
either annual / monthly total or annual / monthly total density as is
summarized in \sref{sec:demandInfo}. Comparing with the statistical
analysis conducted in \sref{boxPlot}, the dynamic energy map not only
reveals the frequency count of energy demand data, but also the
timing.

Apart from holding energy demand and supply data with high
spatial-temporal resolution and provide a general display of map image
series and provide basic data analysis tools as is realized in the
current project, the dynamic energy map should ideally be connected to
an urban-scale energy simulation tool to generate more holistic and
realistic energy demand input data. It should record both the energy
quantity and quality information to facilitate the design of energy
cascading. As a result of the increased complexity of space-time
information, the visualization design should be seriously considered
and carefully designed in order to fulfill the function of conveying
energy demand and supply information with the dynamic energy
map. Advanced space-time data analytical capabilities could assist
more complicated pattern recognition and decision support for more
detailed community level energy supply system design.
