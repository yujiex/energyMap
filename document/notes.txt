Section 2--

e)Much better--though you need to say a little more either in the
descriptions, in a summary paragraph afterwards, or both, about the
software/ techniques/output info that characterize each map,
particularly since you're focusing a great deal on the software and
techniques in your project.  Some nice examples here.

g) I've attached a few separate comments on Section 3.

At the end of the prior section, or the beginning
of this one, you need to summarize the characteristics and strategies
of the energy maps youâ€™ve cited in Section 2.  Describe how the maps
are created, what is depicted in the map, what information is
conveyed, what their limitiations are.  This lets you move forward to
your work.
