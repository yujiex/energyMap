Why are district systems and community energy planning getting more attention these days?  Can you relate this to energy supply and climate change?  If you do this, the reason or motivation for your project becomes clearer.

This sentence isn't clear--what are you trying to say?
More specically, built environment influence the energy throughput
in the form of land use design and infrastructure layout

In your first section, your words still imply that energy maps and energy mapping are long-standing and well-defined practices.  As we discussed at our last meeting, they are not.  As an example, in Paragraph 5, 1st sentence, you use the word, "traditional."  There is no tradition--this is an evolving field.  If you make this clear, your Objective and Problem Definition will be clearer and more interesting.

In Objective and Problem Definition, indicate your project's relationship to our prior work.

In 1.3.1,

a)  "District thermal" is typically used to clarify that there isn't any power generation. What are you reading that defines district thermal as a system that includes electricity generation?  The terminology isn't absolute, but generally in the US, we're most interested in electricity production, so a "district energy" system means one that has power production (electricity).  "District thermal" is a way to indicate that no electricity is being produced--it's just heating.

b) district systems can also be ambient temperature water (which is why the Water Source Heat Maps were done--interesting project!)

c) On p 4,. 2nd paragraph, if you use the term "central power plant," be very careful to clarify your meaning.  A power plant means electricity production, and a central power plant usually means a large plant that's part of our central grid in the US.  If you mean a district energy cogeneration system, say that clearly.  Also, last sentence in that paragraph, indicate how a district system reduces harmful gas emissions.  What gases and how are they reduced?

1.3.2
d) Remember that "heat map" is used in many contexts.  You may want to say, "With respect to buildings, a "heat map" may be defined as..." Again, tone down the use of definitions as though this is carved in stone.  You may want to say something like, "[Name] in his/her work on [project], defined a heat map as ....

Section 2--

e)Much better--though you need to say a little more either in the descriptions, in a summary paragraph afterwards, or both, about the software/ techniques/output info that characterize each map, particularly since you're focusing a great deal on the software and techniques in your project.  Some nice examples here.

f) What is HEM?  Define.

g) I've attached a few separate comments on Section 3.

I may be close to campus tomorrow and if I am, I'll drop off my hard copy with comments.

The academic calendar says that Summer Session grades are due tomorrow (Sunday) by 4 pm.  However, Darlene said you didn't register with me for this course so the Registrar's office is not asking me to submit a grade.  Please send me as much of your work as you can by Tuesday before noon. I'll send my comments to you with a copy to Volker, Khee Poh and Ramesh since they were involved in your thesis work and summer registration.
